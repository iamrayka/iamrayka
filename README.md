# Hello There, I'm Rayka 👋

Welcome to my GitHub page. It’s not much, but it’s home to my dabblings in code and the occasional (hopefully) useful project. I like coding—a lot, actually—though I won't shout it from the rooftops. 🤫

## What I Tinker With 🛠️

I spend my time wrestling with:

- **ASP.NET, .NET Core & C#:** Somehow, these web applications and services get built. It's a mystery. 🕵️‍♂️
- **JavaScript, CSS, & HTML:** I attempt to make things look nice and work well on the internet. Occasionally, I succeed. 🎨
- **T-SQL:** For when I need to ask the database nicely for data and hope it listens. 🗣️📊
- **Selenium:** Automating tests so I can make sure things break before anyone else finds out. 💔🤖

## Beyond Code 🌌

I don’t just code. I also partake in other ventures, though with varying degrees of success:

- **Product & Software Design:** I try to make things user-friendly. After all, someone has to. 🧑‍🎨
- **Philosophy:** Contemplating the bigger questions, like why my code isn’t working as intended. 🤔

## Let's Have a Chat ☕

If you fancy a chat about code, the universe, or anything in between, do reach out. I’m always up for a good natter about the latest tech shenanigans or philosophical conundrums.

Cheers for stopping by. 🍻
